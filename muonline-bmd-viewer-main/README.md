# MU Online Client Editor

A modern, web-based toolkit for inspecting and editing MU Online client files. Built with TypeScript, Three.js, and Vite, it provides interactive 3D viewers for `.bmd` models and terrain, alongside data browsers for items, skills, GFx UI, and sound assets.

> **Version** 1.1.0 | **License** ISC

## Features

### Core Viewers

- **Model Viewer**: Load and inspect `.bmd` 3D models with drag-and-drop support. Browse entire folders of models with auto-generated thumbnails. Automatic texture search in Electron.
- **Character Viewer**: Preview character models with customizable equipment (helm, armor, pants, gloves, boots, left/right hand weapons, wings), item effects (level +0 to +15, Excellent, Ancient), 15+ character classes across all tiers, animation control, and presets.
- **World/Terrain Viewer**: Load and explore MU Online world terrain with interactive camera, object selection with transform gizmo (move/rotate), object isolation, object overrides (persisted to JSON), minimap navigation, bookmarks, and OBJ export.

### Data Browsers

- **Items Browser**: Parse and explore `items.bmd` files with equipment stats, search, and item kind filtering (Weapon, Armor, Potion, Jewel).
- **Skills Browser**: Parse and explore `skill.bmd` files with skill statistics, search, and type filtering (Attack, Buff, De-Buff, Friendly).
- **ATT Inspector**: Inspect terrain attribute data (`.att` files) with interactive map canvas, flag layer toggles, and per-tile tooltips.
- **OZJ/OZT Browser**: Browse `.ozj` and `.ozt` texture files with thumbnail grid, full-size preview, navigation, search, and format filtering.
- **GFx Browser**: Load and render `.ozg`, `.gfx`, `.swf` UI files on a zoomable/pannable stage canvas. View embedded bitmaps in a gallery, browse SWF tag tables, and load `.ozd` texture galleries with DDS decoding.
- **Sound Browser**: Browse and play `.ogg`, `.wav`, `.mp3` sound files from a folder with playback controls, volume slider, and filename search.

### 3D Model Features

- **Texture Support**: Apply various texture formats including `.jpg`, `.png`, `.tga`, `.ozj`, `.ozt` with automatic blend-mode detection.
- **Renderer Backend**: Choose between Auto (prefer WebGPU), WebGPU, or WebGL renderer per viewer. Automatic fallback when WebGPU is unavailable.
- **Animation Playback**: View all embedded animations with adjustable playback speed and enable/disable toggle.
- **External Animations**: Load bone animations from a different `.bmd` file.
- **Attachment System**: Attach a secondary `.bmd` model to any bone of the main model with bone selection via dropdown or slider.
- **Frame Lock**: Lock the animation on a specific frame with "Set Current" convenience button.
- **Viewport Helpers**: Toggle wireframe, skeleton, bounding box, axes, and vertex normals visibility.
- **Scene Controls**: Adjust model scale, scene brightness, and background color. Auto-rotate toggle.
- **Mesh Blending**: Fine-tune texture blending mode and alpha threshold per mesh when automatic material detection needs correction.
- **GIF Export**: Export model animations as `.gif` with configurable resolution, frame delay, and smoothness multiplier.
- **GLB Export**: Export models and animations to `.glb` format (standard or AI-baked with skinned mesh pre-bake).
- **Texture Export**: Export all applied textures to `.png` format.
- **Model Folder Browser**: Load a folder of `.bmd` files and browse them with auto-generated 3D thumbnail previews and lazy rendering.
- **Diagnostics Panel**: View real-time info about the loaded model - mesh vertices, bone count, animation clips, key count, current frame, and FPS.

### Character Viewer Features

## How to Use

### Navigation

The application uses a tabbed interface with 9 workspaces:

| Tab | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Model** | View `.bmd` 3D models with textures, animations, and attachments |
| **Character** | Preview characters with customizable class, equipment, and effects |
| **World** | Explore terrain with interactive camera and object editing |
| **ATT** | Analyze terrain attribute files with color-coded TWFlags map |
| **OZJ** | Browse `.ozj`/`.ozt` texture files with grid and preview |
| **Items** | Search and inspect item definitions from `items.bmd` |
| **Skills** | Search and inspect skill definitions from `skill.bmd` |
| **GFx** | Render `.ozg`/`.gfx`/`.swf` UI files and browse `.ozd` textures |
| **Sound** | Browse and play `.ogg`/`.wav`/`.mp3` sound files |

### Model Viewer Workflow

1. **Load a Model**: Drag and drop a `.bmd` file onto the drop zone, or click to open the file selector. In Electron, native file dialog is used automatically.
2. **Browse a Folder**: Drop or select a folder of `.bmd` files to browse models with thumbnail previews.
3. **Apply Textures**: Once the model is loaded, the viewer shows required textures. Drop the corresponding texture files (`.jpg`, `.tga`, `.ozj`, `.ozt`). In Electron, textures are searched automatically.
4. **Control Animations**: Use the animation buttons to play different clips, adjust speed, enable/disable, or lock a specific frame.
5. **Attach Models**: Drop an attachment `.bmd` and select a bone to attach it to.
6. **Adjust Viewport**: Toggle wireframe, skeleton, bounding box, axes, normals; change background color and brightness; switch renderer backend.
7. **Export**: Use export buttons for GLB, AI GLB (baked), textures (PNG), or GIF.

### Character Viewer Workflow

1. **Load Game Data**: Drop the game `Data` folder to populate class and equipment lists.
2. **Choose a Class**: Select a character class from the dropdown (15+ classes across all tiers).
3. **Equip Items**: Set helm, armor, pants, gloves, boots, weapons, and wings.
4. **Adjust Item Effects**: Set item level (+0 to +15), toggle Excellent/Ancient, adjust glow intensity.
5. **Save Presets**: Save and restore the current configuration.
6. **Export**: Record a GIF of the character.

### World/Terrain Workflow

1. **Load Game Data**: Drop the `Data` folder and select a world to load.
2. **Navigate**: Use the minimap or jump to coordinates. Save bookmarks for quick access.
3. **Inspect ATT**: Toggle ATT overlay to visualize terrain flags; use the ATT Inspector tab for detailed per-tile lookup.
4. **Select Objects**: Click objects in the scene; use the gizmo to move or rotate them. Right-click for the object editor panel.
5. **Edit Objects**: Adjust position, scale, and material overrides. Settings persist to `terrain-object-overrides.json`.
6. **Export**: Export world geometry as OBJ.

### Data Browser Workflow

1. **Load Files**: Drag and drop `items.bmd`, `skill.bmd`, `.att`, `.ozj`/`.ozt`, `.ozg`/`.gfx`/`.swf`/`.ozd`, or sound folders into the respective browser tabs.
2. **Search**: Use the search bar to find specific entries by name, index, or ID.
3. **Filter**: Use type/kind/format filters to narrow down results.
4. **View Details**: Click any row to see detailed information in the detail panel.

### Bookmarks and Presets

- **Terrain Bookmarks**: Save camera positions in the World viewer for quick navigation.
- **Character Presets**: Save and manage character class, equipment, and render state configurations.
